# CIFAR-10 Classifier with PyTorch & Lightning

This project compares **vanilla PyTorch** and **PyTorch Lightning** implementations of a CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset â€” a hands-on deep learning project designed to bridge classic machine learning with more modern, scalable frameworks.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/reneking-tech/cifar10-lightning.git
cd cifar10-lightning

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


### 3. Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Run the notebook

bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/cifar10_classifier.ipynb
